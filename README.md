# Tourism-dashboard-with-tableau-
A very interactive dashboard for tourism where user can enter their budget, their temperature and weather preference to see top destinations.

Many people love to travel. They seek out new places like vibrant cities, cozy small towns, and beautiful natural environments like beaches and forests. But what's the point of saying this if the place is not according to one's temperature compatibility or say according to one's weather suitability. It all goes into vain when you don't have required budget in your hand. So, to solve this problem, I am presenting one of my first dashboard here created in tableau. It is based on a tourism dataset of more than 50 countries taking into account the budget, weather preferences, temperature suitability and various other cultural, natural and entertainment factors. Please have a look and suggest some changes if required.
